    "# Getting Started with Dash and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through setting up a new Dash project, initializing it with Git, creating a virtual environment, managing libraries with `requirements.txt`, and posting your project to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create a Project Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by creating a new folder for your Dash project.\n",
    "- Open the folder in **VS Code**. This folder will act as the repository for all your project files, ensuring everything is organized in one place for easy version control using Git and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment helps manage your project's dependencies without affecting global libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your **Git Bash** terminal or **VS Code** terminal.\n",
    "2. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **For Windows**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python -m venv venv\n",
    "     source venv/Scripts/activate\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **For Mac/Linux**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "     source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After activation, your terminal prompt should show `(venv)` indicating that the virtual environment is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Add the Virtual Environment to `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure your virtual environment directory is not tracked by Git, you should add it to a `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Please ensure you initialize you local as github repository first. \n",
    "  \n",
    " ```bash\n",
    "    git init\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory (if it doesn't already exist):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   touch .gitignore\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the `.gitignore` file and add the following line:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   venv/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "or   **Add the virtual environment directory to your `.gitignore` file** if you haven't already:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   echo \"venv/\" >> .gitignore\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This ensures that Git will ignore this directory in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Commit the changes**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add .gitignore\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Remove virtual environment from tracking and add to .gitignore\"\n",
    "This tells Git to ignore the `venv/` directory, preventing it from being committed to your repository. This keeps your repository clean and avoids including unnecessary files.\n"
